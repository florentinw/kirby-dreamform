# Fields

## What are fields?

Fields are the building blocks of your form. They define what data, how it can be submitted, as well as validate & sanitize it. A field doesn't have to be a form input, it can also be a button or simply a text/label.

By default, Kirby Dream Form includes the following fields:

- Single-line Text
- Multi-line Text
- Checkboxes
- Email Address
- Dropdown
- Button
- Hidden Field
