# Kirby Dream Form

**_Form creation, validation & handling as smooth as a Warp Star Ride._**

Kirby Dream Form is a plugin for [Kirby CMS](https://getkirby.com/) that allows you to create forms with a layout builder interface. It's easy to expand and customize, and built with Kirby's native field types.

It is currently in development and used privately for my own projects.

## Comparison

### Dream Form vs. Uniform

Uniform is a toolkit for creating forms, it especially helps with server-side validation. Dream Form heavily takes inspiration and expands upon some concepts of Uniform and adds panel controls. It's more of a "form builder" than a "form toolkit".

## License

Kirby Dream Form is not free software. In order to run it on a public server, you'll have to purchase a valid Kirby license & a valid plugin license or subscription.
