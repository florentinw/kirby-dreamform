<small id="1"><sup>1</sup> Technically, you can built most of the features that DreamForm offers yourself using Uniform. For a fair comparison, this table only includes features that can be solved by copying code from the official docs & without writing custom code. </small>

<small id="2"><sup>2</sup> Since Uniform focuses on form validation, all fields are technically possible, but none ship with pre-built HTML snippets. </small>
